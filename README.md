# Chess
This is my attempt at a Chess game using Python and Pygame. 

To play the game, download and open the file.

The colors of the board, background and the images were taken from Chess.com through inspect element, aside from that, all the python code was written by me, Ali.

You can see through the source code, that every object's size is based on the size of the screen, so the entire game can be scaled up and down by changing that variable.

I created this game many months ago and since, I have learnt many new efficient methods of using pygame, which I may use to recreate a better version of this game.

All the pieces can only move where the rules allow, a Pawn only moves forwards, Bishop only moves diagonally etc.

TODO:
Implement the rule of En Passent, as well as Castling.
